# Lesson 4 Chrome Devtools and Css Box Model
DEVTOOLS
 We can see devtools of any website by right click -> inspect.
 There we can see the html code and css styles.
 
Css Box Model
 Here we can see the exact padding,margin,border size.
 Padding takes 4 value :padding right,padding left,padding top,padding bottom.
 padding is the distance of contents inside the box and the border of the box.
 It makes sure that the contents of box doesn't overflow the box inside the box adjusts its size accordingly.
 So we can use padding instead of height and width.

Note: The browser aligns all the buttons according to thier text so to avoid misalignment we change the alignment with the help of css property called vertical-top:align .
