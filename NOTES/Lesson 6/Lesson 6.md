We have a standard html code structure.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title><title>
<style></style></head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html> : This lines tells the browser that we're using modern version of the html.
<head>: Any  elements used in this , are not visible on the page.
<body>: Everthing we write here is visible on the page.

We can even store all the css part in another file to make our main file look more clean and call all the css properties by using:
<link rel="" href="">
rel stands for relation we give it a "stylesheet".
href gives the path of the file "filepath".
